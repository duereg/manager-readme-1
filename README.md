# My Manger README

Welcome to my readme, I am glad you are here. I hope information in this page help us to work more effectively together.

# A Little About me.

I am an athlete and adventure-seeker and I love traveling. I grew up in Iran, lived in the Uk for more than Six years and then moved to US. I am proud to call these 3 countries my home.

Weekends or after work you can find me:

- In Nature running, cycling, swimming or skiing.
- Traveling.
- Attending a conference/meet-up.
- Spending time with friends(colleagues) & family.
- Sitting in a coffee shop and reading/learning  & trying to be better at what I do.
- Checking things out of my bucket list.


I love good foods but good company is more important to me, I only cook Persian food if I have more than 6 friends over specially if it is [Ghormeh Sabzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghormeh_sabzi).


# Work/Life Balance

I am a big believer in work life balance, it is hard to respond to emails or slack messages when I am skiing, cycling or traveling outside of work hours(~0800 to ~1800).

If it is urgent feel free to call me anytime.

I do not expect my team to work during weekend or responding to me.

All of this is just for me contacting you, not being on-call or being paged by production systems.
